These data are related to paper"An Empirical Study on Malicious SMS-Based Apps". (Under review)

To contribute to relevant research topics, such as AI-based interpretable malicious behavior classification, we release 56 malware samples as a benchmark. We hope they can be used as a fundamental dataset in future SMS-based malware research.
