Currently, I am a research fellow in Cyber Security Research Centre (CYSREN), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My PI is Prof. LIU Yang (2021-now).
Previously, I was a research assistant (2014-2021) in School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

I obtained my Ph.D. (2016-2021) degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I was supervised by [Prof. LIU Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. LIN Shang-Wei](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00861){:target="_blank"}.
I obtained my B.E. (2010-2014) degree in computer science from Tianjin University, China.
